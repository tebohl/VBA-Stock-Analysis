# VBA-challenge
In this project, I organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 generated sample projects from Crowdfunding platforms to determine rate of success.

I used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live. I created new columns for Percent Funded and Averag Donation that use a formulas to uncover how much money a campaign made relative to its initial goal and how much each project backer paid on average.

I created several pivot tables to reference the initial worksheet, one of which to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category along with a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table. I also created two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns. I also used a formula to convert timestamps to a normal date within the deadline and launched_at columns.

Lastly, I addressed some questions regarding the data:
Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
What are some limitations of this dataset?
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
